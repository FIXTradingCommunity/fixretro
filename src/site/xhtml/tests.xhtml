    <h1>Tests</h1>

    <p>Embarassingly none.</p>

    <p>The testing that was done was to process the 2010 Edition,
    and then feed this into Lasalletech FIX Explorer 2.2.2,
    to generate schemas and then translate some messages between tag=value
    and this FIXML variant, using FixConv.</p>
